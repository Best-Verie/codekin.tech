Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

```python
def foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
```

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```

Here's a definition list:

apples
: Good for making applesauce.
oranges
: Citrus!
tomatoes
: There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
| Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:


Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

```bash
$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$
```
And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

```bash
  cat name.txt
```

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:


As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:


(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```

### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:

    -   carrots
    -   celery
    -   lentils

2.  Boil some water.

3.  Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.


```go
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

```python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
```
